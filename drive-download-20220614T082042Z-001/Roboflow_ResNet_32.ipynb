In their mission statement it is stated that not only do they want to accelerate and help deep learning research, they also want to decrease the entry barriers for everyone. This line is from their introduction of `PyTorch` for `Fastai` back in September 2017 [(Source)](https://www.fast.ai/2017/09/08/introducing-pytorch-for-fastai/):\n","\n","    Everybody should be able to use deep learning to solve their problems with no more education than it takes to use a smart phone. Therefore, each year our main research goal is to be able to teach a wider range of deep learning applications, that run faster, and are more accurate, to people with less prerequisites.\n","\n","You can feel this ambition even if you watch `Fastai`'s 2019 course, and it's something that gives me a good feeling about the direction the field is headed. As it often happens in research, knowledge and tools are only accessible to a certain minority. This is even more pronounced in deep learning research, where you need huge amounts of RAM in powerful GPUs to solve a lot of problems (check this unrelated [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-P28LKWTzrI) on GPU vs CPU)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8tC3ygWxuT_0"},"source":["### Setting up Google Colab\n","To avoid redundancy online, please check this [Medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/fast-ai-lesson-1-on-google-colab-free-gpu-d2af89f53604) by [Manikanta Yadunanda](https://towardsdatascience.com/@manikantayadunanda) for a quick introduction on how to use the Google Colaboratory (Colab) with `Fastai`.
